### Overview

Add an order name to enter data into MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). We followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and MySQL to query and route data in our app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.


* MySql Burger Joint lets users input burger orders.

* When an order name is submitted, the order name will show on the left side of the page.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database until you delete it with the `Delete` button.
